# TkD-Auto
For my final project in the second year of the second semester of the MGIT 2201.3 course -
Web Systems and Technologies 

I have diligently adhered to the lecturer's instructions, 
exclusively utilizing HTML as the primary web development language. The culmination of my 
efforts has resulted in the creation of an interactive website aimed at catering to students
who possess a keen interest in pursuing online learning opportunities. The platform offers a 
user-friendly and engaging interface, providing a diverse array of educational resources to 
facilitate seamless and effective learning experiences. Emphasizing simplicity, accessibility, 
and functionality, this website is designed to empower students in their educational journey, 
enabling them to explore and embrace the advantages of online learning.
